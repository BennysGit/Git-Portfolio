Dino Dash is a small scale game I am working on as practice for game development.

The images provide the steps taken in the character design process for the player and enemy.The images include the sketches of multiple ideas for the player and enemy, final coloured concepts of the enemy (Bizard) and player (Radical Reptile), and the animated pixel sprite adaptations of the final concept to be used in the game.

The file contains a playable build of DinoDash, created in Unity. To play the game, open DinoDash.exe, although as the menu has not been implimented yet, there is no in-game method of quitting, requiring alternative methods of closing the program.
