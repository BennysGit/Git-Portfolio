This folder contains a couple of my project I've been working on in 2025, to develop my experience with a variety of mediums and for fun multi-media experiments.

- Evil Datamoshed Cube: An experiment with data-moshing, rendering smoke effects, mixing 3D with images and ominous sound design. It's designed to be loopable, and consists of afew layers of renders, overlayed.

- (WIP) Skele Board Design: A currently unfinished design for a skateboard. This project is my first attempt at doing a full art piece, and aims to explore combined themes of nature, time, and technology.
