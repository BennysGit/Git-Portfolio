I no longer have the project files themselves for these projects made during the HSC
In order of appearance, these documents are;

For the gardening app (named Plants Matter) I designed using XAML and C# in Microsoft Visual Studio as well as an android phone emulator in tandem with my own phone
- The story board used to plan the appearance and functionality of the app
- A manual explaining how to download and use the app

For the educational rainforest game I designed using C# in Microsoft Visual Studio and Unity
- The models and documentation used in a report after the completion of the game
- The design brief used to plan and understand the game and goals of development beforehand
