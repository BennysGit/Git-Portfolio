This is the GitHub stored portfolio to display my abilities and understanding of a variety of development softwares and practices. Each file has their own ReadMe note within them that further explains their respective content.

I have used GitHub to create my portfolio as I do not have a website portfolio at this time, as well as to display my ability to use Github. Additionally, I have used GitGUI, GitBash and GitLFS in order to upload the 3D SolidBug.obj file as it was too large to upload normally.

I also have a demonstration of my 3D unity game development ability and understanding that is on google drive and can be accessed using this link:
