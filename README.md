This is the GitHub stored portfolio to display my abilities and understanding of a variety of development softwares and practices. 
To use this GitHub page as a portfolio I have used GitGUI, GitBash and GitLFS in order to upload the 3D SolidBug.obj file as it was too large to upload normally.

I also have a demonstration of my 3D unity game development ability and understanding as part of my university course, which is available via the following google drive link:

And some additonal content is available via my dev log instagram:

Each folder of this git contains their own seperate Readme that provides an overview of their content.
